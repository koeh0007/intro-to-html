        <h2>About Me</h2>




        <p>Hi, my name is Cindy Koehne! I'm a first year student in the Graphic Design program at Algonquin College. I'm from a small town just outside of Toronto called Uxbridge where my parents live with our 4 cats. I have a huge passion for graphic design, which I discovered in grade 9 when I took a Yearbook course. In grade 12 I ran the Yearbook class with 4 others where we taught, guided and created our schools Yearbook. While it was a lot of work it taught me many valuable skills that come into play with the Graphic Design program. </p>

        <p>While being at school I have been developing my skills to become a better graphic designer. After I graduate I have many personal goals I would like to accomplish, some including graphic design and others just being things I want to do. Some of my graphic design goals are to start a small buisness to show off my designs by making puzzles, wall art, t-shirts, and other clothing. I'd also love to make a colouring book where I can put some of my favourite designs for others to colour.</p>
